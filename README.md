# My Cybersecurity Write-ups & Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity repository! This is a collection of my write-ups for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, security analysis from platforms like LetsDefend, and solutions for rooms on TryHackMe. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, share knowledge, and create a portfolio of my skills in both offensive and defensive security.

## PicoCTF Write-ups

This directory contains my solutions and detailed explanations for challenges from various **PicoCTF** competitions. The write-ups are organized into sub-folders based on their category, such as `Forensics`, `Cryptography`, `Web Exploitation`, and more.

**Browse the [`PicoCTF`](./PicoCTF/) directory to explore all the solutions.**

## LetsDefend - Security Analyst Alerts

Here, I document my analysis and response procedures for security alerts from the **[LetsDefend](https://letsdefend.io/)** platform. These write-ups cover my thought process for investigating, containing, and remediating potential threats, simulating the work of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst.

**Explore the [`LetsDefend`](./Lets'sDefend/) directory for detailed alert analyses and malware deconstructions.**

## TryHackMe Rooms

This section is dedicated to my write-ups for rooms on the **[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)** platform. It includes solutions for various challenges covering everything from basic networking and Linux skills to advanced penetration testing techniques.

*(This section will be updated as rooms are completed.)*
